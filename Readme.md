## PROJECT :
This project focuses on creating a machine learning model for hand gesture recognition and classification from images. The code mounts Google Drive to access a dataset of hand gesture images, retrieves and lists the images, and loads a pre-trained TensorFlow model to perform gesture classification. It also displays the model’s architecture to provide insights into its design.
## Tools used:
- Python
- OpenCv
- NumPy
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
