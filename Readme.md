## PROJECT IDEA :
This project focuses on creating a machine learning model for hand gesture recognition and classification from images. The code mounts Google Drive to access a dataset of hand gesture images, retrieves and lists the images, and loads a pre-trained TensorFlow model to perform gesture classification. It also displays the modelâ€™s architecture to provide insights into its design.
## Tools Used :
- Python
- OpenCv
- NumPy
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
